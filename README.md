# California-Election-data
This project is a GIS analysis of based on an election carried out in California

## Scenerio
For this project, I participated in a scenario, working in the field of electoral politics and specifically interested in ballot measures, where citizens vote directly to enact new laws. As a GIS analyst for a nongovernmental organization that opposed California’s 2012 ballot measure that would have required labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food. My task is to look at the broad voting patterns in California on this issue, knowing that the initiative did not gain enough votes to pass.

## Task
I have been tasked with aggregating the precinct information up to the county level polygons – which your agency partner has also provided you in a file geodatabase.

The precinct level voting data has attributes for who voted in favor of the measure, as well as the total number of voters. The interest is in a normalized map, showing percentage of voters rather than total number of voters, I will need to aggregate both of these attributes to the counties, the most likely tool being a spatial join, then create a normalized map of the voting data in order to better assess the geography of the issue.

When done, I will create a map of the county-level data with all appropriate elements, as well as labels and metadata.

## Resource used
QGIS

## Conclusion
Out of the 58 conties in California, less than 20 voted (yes) to enact the law (with only 6 having majority vote). The color ramp on the map helps to show the areas where the voters supported the law with respect to areas where it was not supported.
