# California-Election-data
This project is a GIS analysis of based on an election carried out in California


##Scenerio
I have been tasked with aggregating the precinct information up to the county level polygons â€“ which your agency partner has also provided you in a file geodatabase.

The precinct level voting data has attributes for who voted in favor of the measure, as well as the total number of voters. The interest is in a normalized map, showing percentage of voters rather than total number of voters, you will need to aggregate both of these attributes to the counties, the most likely tool being a spatial join, then create a normalized map of the voting data in order to better assess the geography of the issue.

When done, you will create a map of the county-level data with all appropriate elements, as well as labels and metadata.
